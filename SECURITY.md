| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [security advisory feature](https://github.com/emiliancristea/webterminal/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish with this vulnerability
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, and version information
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 2 weeks, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is released

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

#### Command Execution Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Commands run in isolated temporary directories
- **Command Filtering**: Dangerous commands are blocked (e.g., `sudo`, `rm -rf /`)
- **Path Restrictions**: Operations limited to session-specific directories
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory usage constraints

#### Network Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **WebSocket Security**: Origin validation and rate limiting
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing setup
- **Security Headers**: Appropriate HTTP security headers

#### Session Management
- **Session Isolation**: Each session operates independently
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Sessions and temporary files are cleaned up
- **No Persistent State**: No server-side session state leakage

### Deployment Security

#### Production Recommendations

1. **Container Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Always run in a containerized environment
   docker run --rm -it --read-only webterminal
   ```

2. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**
   ```nginx
   # Use a reverse proxy with security headers
   add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
   add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
   add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
   add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";
   ```

3. **Network Security**
   - Configure firewall rules to restrict access
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting at the proxy level

4. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Never commit secrets to source code
   # Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Command Execution Environment**
   - Commands run in the host system context
   - Additional containerization recommended for production

2. **File System Access**
   - Limited to temporary directories
   - No access to system-critical files

3. **Network Access**
   - Commands can make network requests
   - Consider network policies in production

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Containerization**
   ```dockerfile
   # Run in a minimal container with restricted privileges
   FROM node:18-alpine
   RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
   RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
   USER nextjs
   ```

2. **Process Isolation**
   ```javascript
   // Use process restrictions
   const child = spawn(command, args, {
     uid: 1001,
     gid: 1001,
     cwd: sessionDirectory,
     timeout: 30000
   });
   ```

3. **Resource Limits**
   ```javascript
   // Implement resource constraints
   const limits = {
     maxBuffer: 1024 * 1024, // 1MB
     timeout: 30000,         // 30 seconds
     killSignal: 'SIGKILL'
   };
   ```

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest versions
- [ ] Run security audit: `npm audit`
- [ ] Configure proper HTTPS certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Test security headers and CORS policies
- [ ] Verify WebSocket security configuration
- [ ] Review environment variable configuration

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor for security advisories
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Update security documentation

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process
