## Migration Guide

### From Development to Production

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
   ```

2. **Build Process**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Deploy in containerized environment
   - Configure reverse proxy for WebSocket support
   - Set up appropriate firewall rules
